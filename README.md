# react-native-component-preview
A small typescript library for previewing react-native components. 

With this library we can render components using different props to see how they look in a different state. Opinionated Pros:
- Faster Development flow as you can see multiple components rendering with different props at once.
- Enforces of separation between UI and business logic. Smaller files, better readablity.
- Testable components & code.
